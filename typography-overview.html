        <h2>What is Typography?</h2>
        <p>Typography is more than font choice. It has a significant impact on the overall effectiveness of a website through readability and usability. Not only should the typography be something aesthetically pleasing, it also needs to be easy to read so the information being presented is relatively simple to process. Check out the <a href="font-types-article.html">Font Types Article</a> for a visual explanation of differences between a selection of fonts to see how the typography can aid or hinder. Then look at the <a href="typography-article.html">Typography Article</a> to see these principles in action on a handful of websites.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Font</strong>: What most people think of when typography is mentioned. Font choice is only a part of typography but it is arguably one of the most important as its legibility can make or break the typography as a whole.</li>
            <li><strong>Hierarchy</strong>: The size of titles and headers versus the body should be distinct and helpful to guide the reader.</li>
            <li><strong>Spacing</strong>: Using appropriate spacing between lines, characters, and margins allows for a calm read and preventing visual clutter.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment</strong>: Proper alignment also has a similar purpose to the spacing as it creates a consistent structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Typography Anatomy</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ascender Line</strong>: An ascender is the part of a lowercase letter that goes above the x-height so the ascender line is the uppermost point of an ascender.</li>
                <li><strong>Cap Height</strong>: The height of an uppercase letter, measured from the baseline to the top of the letter.</li>
                <li><strong>X-Height</strong>: The height of lowercase letters; usually determined by the lowercase 'x'.</li>
                <li><strong>Baseline</strong>: The invisible line on which characters sit.</li>
                <li><strong>Descender Line</strong>: Parts of lowercase letters will extend below the baseline and these are called descenders. Where the lowest point of the descender hits is called the descender line.</li>
                <li><strong>Serif</strong>: These are the "feet" at the end of strokes in certain typefaces. These enhance readability in print and longer passages of text.</li>
                <li><strong>Bracket</strong>: A curved or angled connection between a serif and the main stroke of a letter.</li>
                <li><strong>Terminal</strong>: The end of a stroke without a serif; sometimes rounded, flat, or angled.</li>
                <li><strong>Loop</strong>: A fully or partially closed curve at the bottom of some lowercase letters.</li>
                <li><strong>Stem</strong>: The primary stroke of a character that provides structural support.</li>
                <li><strong>Arm</strong>: Horizontal or upward slanting strokes that do not connect to another stroke.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
