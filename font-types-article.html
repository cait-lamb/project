        <h2>Font Types Article</h2>
        <h4>Types of Fonts within Various Typefaces</h4>
        <p>There are six different typefaces and each kind has a use for which it is best suited. Some are better in textbooks while others are better suited for screens and others for attention grabbing. Once settled on a typeface, it can be fun to search through fonts within that family and decide what best fits the project, functionally and aesthetically.</p>
        <h5>Serif</h5>
        <p>The serif typeface includes fonts that are used in text-heavy applications, like books. This is because the decorative lines, called feet, that are at the end of each character help to guide the reader's eye along the line of text. A couple of example fonts within this typeface are below.</p>
        <table>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>
                        <img src="resources/images/typography/warbler.png" alt="a screenshot of sample text from the font, Warbler">
                        <img src="resources/images/typography/adobe-aldine.png" alt="a screenshot of sample text from the font, Adobe Aldine">
                    </th>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p><a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/warbler">Warbler</a> in Adobe Fonts is a nice serif font that has many variations, depending on the overall look the designer is trying to achieve. Another nice serif font from Adobe is called <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/adobe-aldine">Adobe Aldine</a>. Both of these fonts have the feet that help to guide the reader's eye along each line of text. They are simple and clean and do not distract from the message.</p>
        <h5>Sans Serif</h5>
        <p>Sans-serif typefaces lack the feet that define the previous serifs. They are clean and have modern look, used in both print and digital media. The minimalist style allows for versatility and ease of reading in many formats.</p>
        <table>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>
                        <img src="resources/images/typography/komet.png" alt="a screenshot of sample text from the font, Komet">
                        <img src="resources/images/typography/roboto.png" alt="a screenshot of sample text from the font, Roboto">
                    </th>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p><a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/komet">Komet</a> and <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/roboto">Roboto</a> are two simple, but good, examples of the characteristics of Sans-Serif fonts.</p>
        <h5>Decorative</h5>
        <p>Decorative, also known as display, typefaces are very different from Serif and Sans-Serif. These types of fonts are used for attention grabbing. They are unique and more of a design statement than used for body text. They should be contained to elements like logos or headers as overuse can make readability difficult.</p>
        <table>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>
                       <img src="resources/images/typography/gelato-luxe.png" alt="a screenshot of sample text from the font, Gelato Luxe">
                        <img src="resources/images/typography/flegrei.png" alt="a screenshot of samplet text from the font, Flegrei">
                    </th>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p><a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/gelato-luxe">Gelato Luxe</a> and <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/flegrei">Flegrei</a> are two decorative fonts that would be fun or useful as titles. However, as evidenced by their appearance, they would not be good in the same situations for which a Serif or Sans-Serif is more fitting.</p>
        <h5>Script</h5>
        <p>Script typefaces mimic calligraphy or handwriting. They are more casual fonts and are used in situations like Decorative fonts; branding, logos, and situations where a more artistic touch is preferred.</p>
        <table>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>
                        <img src="resources/images/typography/novantique-script.png" alt="a screenshot of sample text from the font, Novantique Script">
                        <img src="resources/images/typography/absolute-beauty.png" alt="a screenshot of sample text from the font, Absolute Beauty">
                    </th>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p><a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/novantique-script">Novantique Script</a> and <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/absolute-beauty">Absolute Beauty</a> are good examples of Script text that has a more casual, flowing design suited for logos and branding.</p>
        <h5>Monospaced</h5>
        <p>Monospaced typefaces are those that have the same horizontal space and useful for situations requiring technical documentation or coding. Historically, they were also used in typewriters.</p>
        <table>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>
                        <img src="resources/images/typography/chivo-mono.png" alt="a screenshot of sample text from the font, Chivo Mono">
                        <img src="resources/images/typography/nexus-typewriter.png" alt="a screenshot of sample text from the font, Nexus Typewriter">
                    </th>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p><a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/chivo-mono">Chivo Mono</a> and <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/nexus-typewriter">Nexus Typewriter</a> are two good examples of monospaced fonts. Either of these would be good for writing code to keep text aligned.</p>
