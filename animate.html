        <h2>Animate projects</h2>
        <p>See here's the thing, I was going to include some of the text from my write ups. But then I'd have to open another file to remember what I said. And that really feels like a lot more work than I want to do, honestly.</p>
        <h4>Project One - Product Ad</h4>
        <p>Remember how I said to pretend you haven't seen these images before in the <a href="photoshop-ads.html">social media</a> section? Yeah, do that here, too. This banner links out to my employer's webpage about our main software product. Fingers crossed it works now that I've told you.</p>
        <div>
            <iframe src="resources/images/animate/slicwave-product-ad.html"  id="airplaneBanner"></iframe>
        </div>
        <h4>Project Two - Interactive Banner</h4>
        <p>Same thing goes for this one. It's been a definite learning experience on coercing Animate to be my friend long enough to get publish/export to work.</p>
        <p>And by 'a learning experience', I mean that I have yet to get the interactivity on this graphic to work outside of the Animate software itself. So fingers crossed it works but I really don't care to spend more time on this. No one likes Animate anyway.</p>
        <div>
            <iframe src="resources/images/animate/interactive-banner.html" id="interactiveBanner"></iframe>
        </div>
        <h4>Project Three - Animated Infographic</h4>
        <p>And finally, minimal effort, maximum result. Except for this was more than minimum effort since Animate and I regularly get in arguments. I had to redo the little animated dot quite a few times because of varying issues that I finally resolved. (Unlike the project above which might as well be called He-Who-Will-Not-Be-Named).</p>
        <div>
            <iframe src="resources/images/animate/animated-infographic.html" id="infographic"></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>Okay, that's all of them. See you never, Animate.</p>
